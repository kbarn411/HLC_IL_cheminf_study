The discovery of novel solvents is crucial for advancing green chemistry, and chemoinformatics can accelerate this process. Ionic liquids (ILs) have diverse applications, but understanding the link between their structure and properties is key to optimizing their performance. In this study, the use of emerging algorithms in chemoinformatics was explored, such as the CN2 rule algorithm and Model Agnostic Meta Learner (MAML), to improve the predictive power of Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) models for ILs. The data set on carbon dioxide solubility was leveraged to develop predictive artificial intelligence (AI) models, as these techniques are particularly well-suited for addressing complex problems of high scientific interest, such as mitigating CO₂-related environmental issues. The effectiveness of using molecular fingerprints (MFs) and molecular descriptors (MDs) to represent ILs' molecular structures was evaluated to find that MFs are more suitable for rule mining. By incorporating Fractional Free Volume (FFV) alongside MDs, non-linear QSPR models with higher predictive power were obtained. Moreover, integrating COSMO-RS simulated data with MAML allowed to enhance neural network performance. The gradient boosting model utilizing FFV was found to be the best performing. The findings on chemical data interpretation with rules can inform the development of more efficient solvents.
